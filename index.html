                    The objetive of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden mines
                    whitout detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of
                    neighboring mines in each field.
                    <br>
                    Cells have three states: hidden, visible and flagged. A covered cell is blank
                    and clickable, while an uncovered cell is exposed. Flagged cells are those marked by
                    the player to indicate a potential mine location.
                    <br>
                    A player left-clicks a cell to uncover it. If a player uncovers a mined cell, the game ends, as there is only 1 life per game.
                    Otherwise, the uncovered cells displays either a number, indicating the quantity of mines adjacent to it, or a blank tile, and 
                    all adjacent non-mined cells will automatically be uncovered. Right-clicking on a cell will
                    flag it, causing a flag to appear on it. Flagged cells are still considered covered, and a player can click to uncover them,
                    obviously they must first be unflagged with an additional right-click.
                    <br>
                    The first click in any game will never be a mine.
                    <br>
                    To win the game, players must uncover all non-mine cell.
